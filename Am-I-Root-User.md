# How do I find out whether I am logged in as Root User in the AWS Console?

Expand the drop-down menu on the top right corner of your AWS Console. 

If you see a line after "Account Id" with "IAM User" (It may also say "Federated user"), you are currently **not** logged in a Root User.

If there is no line after the Account Id, you are logged in as the Root User.
