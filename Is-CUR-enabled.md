# Do I have Cost and Usage Report configured?

AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) could be configured at the [payer/management account](Payer-And-Member-Accounts.md) level or at the member account level. Typically, this is done at the payer account level and we recommend you log into your payer account to check this.
<br/><br/>
After logging into your AWS Console, navigate to this [page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/reports)

If you have CUR configured, you should see entries similar to this

If you do not see any entries under "AWS Cost and Usage Reports", you do not have it configured currently. Refer this [page](Enabling-and-backfilling-CUR.md) on how to configure it.
